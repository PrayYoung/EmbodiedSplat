## Embodied Splat Sim

**Embodied Splat Sim** is a photorealistic reinforcement learning environment for embodied agents built on 3D Gaussian Splatting.

The project explores how agents can learn navigation and spatial reasoning directly from image observations rendered from real-world scenes. By combining world-model–based scene representations with reinforcement learning, this environment serves as a foundation for research in embodied AI, robotics navigation, and sim-to-real transfer.

This repository provides a lightweight RL environment, agent dynamics, and training pipeline, forming the groundwork for integrating photorealistic 3D scene rendering with policy learning.
